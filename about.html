          <h3> What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h3>
          <p>
        According to Oxford Living Dictionary, artificial itelligence (AI) is defined as "The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages."
        Any device that can percieve its environment and take actions in order to complete a
        goal is considered to have artificial intelligence. AI can range from simple
        digital assistants located in many phones to highly complex machines that have
        high amounts of intelligece.

          <h3>The Future of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
          <p>
AI has been changing the lives of humans for years, and will continue to do so for year into the future.
Many people have unique opinions on the future of artificial intelligence.
Stuart Russell, professor of computer science at university of California, Berkeley, states that AI will help humans solve many problems including global warming.
Pieter Abbeel believes that artificial intelligence will keep humans safer from traffic accidents, natural disasters, and nuclear meltdowns.
Other people believe that AI will improve medical care, revolutionize the way we live and work, and open up new worlds to explore.
AI will have many postive impacts on the future, but there are also so disadvatages to using AI.
Jobs will be taken away from people and given to AI that can do the same job more effiiently.
Also, energy consumption will increase dramatically due to AI systems that use large amounts of power.
AI will be an enormous help to humans in the future and will be used and improved for many years to come.
